# Dotted icons

## Where to find the template

To make a new dotted icon, download and modify the template-dotted-icons.svg file ( /static/img/dotted-icons/template-dotted-icons.svg )

The template SVG file was made in open source vector graphic software Inkscape and can be edited in other vector graphic software.

## How to make a new dotted icon in inkscape

In Inkscape, make sure that the rectangular grid is enabled and visible in file > document properties.

Turn on snapping to grid in snapping options (top right of app window in Inkscape 1.3.2)

Use pencil tool to draw the icon with a stroke width of 5 px with a round "join" and round "cap".

The colors in the template are already set to follow the cardano branding guidelines which at the moment of writing these instructions are the following values.

Blue icon : R : 0 G : 51 B : 173 A : 100
Background dot grid : R : 255 G : 85 B : 83 A : 100

Please delete all the dots that are hidden under the icon's lines in order to make the SVG file lighter and prevent potential issues.
 
## Creative choices

It is important to remain playful and creative and one could for example color some dots blue in order to make a more meaningful icon or convey a specific idea.

While these instructions are for the current grid system, if you think you can design a better grid system, or a better icon system than the current one, submit your ideas to the community. Collaborate and experiment.

Some icons currently have a different, slanted grid system. The template-dotted-icons.svg file was made for the more rigid and square grid because it is the one that most of the current icons use. But why not make a template for the slanted, more relaxed grid style ? Or take inspiration from it and redesign all the icons.

Thank you for your contributions.
