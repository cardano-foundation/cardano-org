:::

## A

**ada** — The native cryptocurrency of the Cardano blockchain. Named after Ada Lovelace, the 19th-century mathematician often regarded as the first computer programmer.

**Alonzo** — The [hard fork on September 12, 2021](/hardforks) that brought smart contract functionality to Cardano.

## B

**Basho** — The [fourth era of Cardano development](/research#basho), focused on scaling and performance optimization. Named after Matsuo Basho, a Japanese poet and master of haiku.

**Byron** — The [first era of Cardano development](/research#byron), establishing the foundation of the network. Named after Lord Byron, the Romantic poet and father of Ada Lovelace.

## C

**Cardano** — A public, permissionless Layer 1 blockchain built on peer-reviewed research. A collection of open-source, patent-free protocols for value transfer, identity, and governance.

**the Cardano Foundation** — An independent, Swiss-based not-for-profit organization responsible for the advancement of Cardano. See [Cardano Foundation](/entities?tab=cf) for details.

## D

**DApp** — Decentralized Application. An application that runs on a blockchain network rather than centralized servers.

**Developer Portal** — An open source project at [developers.cardano.org](https://developers.cardano.org) providing resources for building on Cardano.

**DRep** — Delegated Representative. In Cardano's governance system, ada holders can delegate their voting power to DReps who vote on governance actions on their behalf.

## E

**EMURGO** — A global blockchain solutions company and one of the founding entities of Cardano. See [EMURGO](/entities?tab=emurgo) for details.

## G

**Goguen** — The [third era of Cardano development](/research#goguen), introducing smart contracts and native tokens. Named after Joseph Goguen, an American computer scientist.

**Governance Action** — A formal proposal submitted on-chain for the Cardano community to vote on. Types include treasury withdrawals, protocol parameter changes, and constitutional amendments. See [Governance Actions](https://developers.cardano.org/docs/governance/cardano-governance/governance-actions) for details.

**Governance Tools** — Applications that enable the community to register as DReps, delegate voting power, or vote on governance actions. See [Governance Tools](/apps?tags=governance) for a list.

## H

**hard fork** — A protocol upgrade that is not backward-compatible, requiring all nodes to update. Cardano uses a hard fork combinator to make these transitions smooth.

**Hydra** — A Layer 2 scaling solution for Cardano using state channels (Hydra Heads) to enable fast, low-cost transactions off the main chain.

## I

**Input Output** — A research and engineering company and one of the founding entities of Cardano. Formerly known as IOHK. See [Input Output](/entities?tab=iog) for details.

**Intersect** — A not-for-profit, member-based organization for the Cardano ecosystem focused on governance and community coordination. See [Intersect](/entities?tab=intersect) for details.

## L

**Layer 1** — The base blockchain protocol. Cardano is a Layer 1 blockchain.

**Layer 2** — Protocols built on top of a Layer 1 blockchain to improve scalability or add functionality. Hydra is Cardano's Layer 2 solution.

## M

**Mainnet** — The production Cardano network where real ada transactions occur, as opposed to testnets used for development and testing.

## O

**Ouroboros** — The family of proof-of-stake consensus protocols that power Cardano. Variants include Classic, Praos, Genesis, and Chronos.

## P

**PRAGMA** — A member-based, not-for-profit open source association for blockchain software projects. See [PRAGMA](/entities?tab=pragma) for details.

**proof of stake** — A consensus mechanism where validators are selected to create blocks based on the amount of cryptocurrency they hold and "stake" as collateral. Cardano uses proof of stake via Ouroboros.

**proof of work** — A consensus mechanism where miners compete to solve computational puzzles to create blocks. Bitcoin uses proof of work; Cardano does not.

## S

**scam** — A fraudulent scheme designed to steal funds or personal information, often exploiting trust or lack of knowledge. Common examples include fake giveaways and phishing attacks. See [common scams](/common-scams) for how to protect yourself.

**Shelley** — The [second era of Cardano development](/research#shelley), introducing decentralization and stake pools. Named after Percy Bysshe Shelley, one of the major English Romantic poets.

**sidechains** — Independent blockchains connected to the main Cardano blockchain, enabling interoperability and specialized functionality.

**smart contract** — Self-executing code stored on a blockchain that automatically enforces and executes agreement terms when predefined conditions are met.

**soft fork** — A protocol upgrade that is backward-compatible. Nodes that don't upgrade can still participate in the network.

**spending password** — A password used by wallets to encrypt the private key, adding a layer of security.

**stablecoin** — A cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to a fiat currency like the US dollar. USDM is a stablecoin on Cardano.

**stake pool** — A server node that participates in the Cardano network by validating transactions and producing blocks. Ada holders can delegate their stake to pools to earn rewards.

**style guide** — The [Editorial Style Guide](/docs/get-involved/style-guide) defines writing conventions, spelling standards, and terminology usage for cardano.org content.

## T

**testnet** — A test network for developers to experiment without using real ada. Cardano testnets include Preview and Preprod.

**tps** — Transactions per second. A common but limited metric for measuring blockchain throughput.

## U

**use case** — A specific application or scenario where Cardano technology solves a problem. See [Cardano use cases](/use-cases).

**USDM** — A fiat-backed stablecoin on the Cardano blockchain.

**UTXO** — Unspent Transaction Output. The accounting model used by Cardano (and Bitcoin) where transactions consume previous outputs and create new ones. Cardano extends this with the Extended UTXO (eUTXO) model.

## V

**Voltaire** — The [fifth era of Cardano development](/research#voltaire), focused on governance and treasury management. Named after the French Enlightenment philosopher.

**VRF** — Verifiable Random Function. A cryptographic function used in Ouroboros to fairly select which stake pool creates each block.

## W

**working group** — A group uniting experts and community members to focus on a specific topic within the Cardano ecosystem.
