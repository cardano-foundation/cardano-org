- Use gender-inclusive pronouns they/their/them rathen then he/she.
- Use Oxford comma.
- Spell out one to nine and use numerals for anything higher: 10, 11, 12.


## Cardano Glossary

The Cardano Glossary offers clear definitions of key terms and serves as a style guide to ensure consistency in how we write and communicate about the Cardano ecosystem. It’s a resource for both understanding concepts and aligning on terminology.


### A 
|  Spelling/Term   | Comment                    |
| ---------------- | -------------------------- |
| `ada`            | When talking about the cryptocurrency, do not capitalize, unless at the beginning of a sentence. The idea behind this is to treat it like dollars or euros. If you are in doubt, in English, prefer ada over ADA. Capitalised ADA stands for the ticker symbol only. |
| `ADA`           | The ticker symbol for ada, like EUR or USD. |
| `tAda`          | Test ada is tAda, not tADA or TADA. See `ada`. |
| `Alonzo`        | Name of the [September 12, 2021 hard fork](/hardforks).  |


### B 
|  Spelling/Term   | Comment                    |
| ---------------- | -------------------------- |
| `Basho`           | The [fourth era of the Cardano development](/research#basho) focused on performance. Named after Matsuo Basho, a Japanese poet and the master of haiku. |
| `Byron`           | The [first era in Cardano development](/research#byron). Named after the Romantic poet who was the father of Ada Lovelace. |

### C 
|  Spelling/Term   | Comment                    |
| ---------------- | -------------------------- |
| `Cardano`      | Cardano is a public, permissionless Layer 1 blockchain. A collection of science-based, open-source, patent-free protocols for storing/managing value, identity, governance. |
| `community`      | Always 'the' community, not 'our' community. |
| `the Cardano Foundation`           | The Cardano Foundation is an independent, Swiss-based not-for-profit organization. Always use **the** Cardano Foundation. See the [Cardano Foundation](/entities?tab=cf) for details. |

### D 
|  Spelling/Term   | Comment                    |
| ---------------- | -------------------------- |
| `DApp` | Note the capitalization: Decentralized Application. |
| `Developer Portal` | An open source project on [developers.cardano.org](https://developers.cardano.org) that aims to collect the resources and updates you need to build, integrate, and stay informed about the Cardano blockchain as a developer. |
| `DRep` | Note the capitalization: Delegated Representative. `DRep` as an abbreviation for Delegated Representative follows standard practices for abbreviations in English: taking the first letter of each word. This makes it intuitive and clear in most contexts. It is also in line with the `DApp` abbreviation. In crypto, the lowercase “d“ is often used to signify “decentralized,” as in dApp (decentralized application) or dGov (decentralized governance). Using “dRep” might imply “decentralized representative”.|

### E 
|  Spelling/Term   | Comment                    |
| ---------------- | -------------------------- |
| `EMURGO` | All caps in line with EMURGO’s branding. See [EMURGO](/entities?tab=emurgo) for details.|

| `the Foundation` | Interchangeable with `the Cardano Foundation`, 'the' is not capitalized, but Foundation should be. |

### G 
|  Spelling/Term   | Comment                    |
| ---------------- | -------------------------- |
| `GitHub` | Note the capitalized H. |
| `Goguen` | The [third era of the Cardano development](/research#goguen) focused on smart contracts. Named in honour of Joseph Goguen, an US computer scientist. |

| `stablecoin` | One word. |
| `staking`    | Try to avoid term `staking` without context as it is ambiguous. `staking` refers to the whole process of both delegating and setting up a pool but many people confuse this with the actual process of creating blocks. `delegating` means that people delegate their stake to a stake pool. |

| `TLA`    | Three-letter acrynom. There are too many, avoid them, don't invent new ones. |
