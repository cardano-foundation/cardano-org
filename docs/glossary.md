### EMURGO
A global blockchain solutions company and one of the founding entities of Cardano. See [EMURGO](/entities/?tab=emurgo) for details.

### epoch
A period of five days in the Cardano network during which stake distribution is fixed and rewards are calculated. At each epoch boundary, rewards are distributed to delegators and stake pool operators.

### eUTXO
Extended UTXO. Cardano's enhanced version of the UTXO model that allows data and logic to be attached to outputs, enabling complex smart contract interactions while maintaining predictability and parallelism.

## G

### Goguen
The [third era of Cardano development](/research/#goguen), introducing smart contracts and native tokens. Named after Joseph Goguen, an American computer scientist.

### Governance Action
A formal proposal submitted on-chain for the Cardano community to vote on. Types include treasury withdrawals, protocol parameter changes, and constitutional amendments. See [Governance Actions](https://developers.cardano.org/docs/governance/cardano-governance/governance-actions) for details.

### Governance Tools
Applications that enable the community to register as DReps, delegate voting power, or vote on governance actions. See [Governance Tools](/apps/?tags=governance) for a list.

## H

### hard fork
A protocol upgrade that is not backward-compatible, requiring all nodes to update. Cardano uses a hard fork combinator to make these transitions smooth. See [hard forks](/hardforks/).

### Hydra
A Layer 2 scaling solution for Cardano using state channels (Hydra Heads) to enable fast, low-cost transactions off the main chain.

## I

### Input Output
A research and engineering company and one of the founding entities of Cardano. Formerly known as IOHK. See [Input Output](/entities/?tab=iog) for details.

### Intersect
A not-for-profit, member-based organization for the Cardano ecosystem focused on governance and community coordination. See [Intersect](/entities/?tab=intersect) for details.

## L

### Layer 1
The base blockchain protocol. Cardano is a Layer 1 blockchain.

### Layer 2
Protocols built on top of a Layer 1 blockchain to improve scalability or add functionality. Hydra is Cardano's Layer 2 solution.

## M

### Mainnet
The production Cardano network where real ada transactions occur, as opposed to testnets used for development and testing.

### Mary
The [hard fork on March 1, 2021](/hardforks/) that introduced native tokens, allowing users to create and transact with custom tokens directly on Cardano.

## N

### native token
A token created and managed directly on the Cardano blockchain using its built-in token functionality, without requiring smart contracts. Introduced in the Mary hard fork.

### NFT
Non-Fungible Token. A unique digital asset on the blockchain representing ownership of items like art, collectibles, or in-game assets.

## O

### Ouroboros
The family of proof-of-stake consensus protocols that power Cardano. Variants include Classic, Praos, Genesis, and Chronos. See [Ouroboros](/ouroboros/) for details.

## P

### pool saturation
The point at which a stake pool has received more delegation than is optimal for rewards. Beyond saturation, additional delegation yields diminishing returns, encouraging stake distribution across multiple pools.

### PRAGMA
A member-based, not-for-profit open source association for blockchain software projects. See [PRAGMA](/entities/?tab=pragma) for details.

### Project Catalyst
Cardano's innovation and [treasury](/insights/supply/summary/#treasury) funding platform where ada holders propose, discuss, and vote on projects to receive funding from the Cardano treasury.

### soft fork
A protocol upgrade that is backward-compatible. Nodes that don't upgrade can still participate in the network.

### spending password
A password used by wallets to encrypt the private key, adding a layer of security.

### stablecoin
A cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to a fiat currency like the US dollar. USDM is a stablecoin on Cardano.

### stake pool
A server node that participates in the Cardano network by validating transactions and producing blocks. Ada holders can delegate their stake to pools to earn rewards. See the [staking calculator](/calculator/) to estimate returns.
