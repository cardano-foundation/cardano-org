# Healthcare

## The Challenge

Healthcare data is fragmented across providers, making it difficult for patients and doctors to access complete medical histories. This fragmentation leads to repeated tests, dangerous drug interactions, and delayed diagnoses. In emergencies, critical information may be unavailable.

Current systems also create privacy and security risks. Centralized databases are attractive targets for hackers, and patients have limited control over who accesses their sensitive health information.

## How Blockchain Solves This

Blockchain-based health records give patients control over their complete medical history:

- **Patient ownership**: Individuals control access to their health data
- **Portability**: Access records from any provider, anywhere in the world
- **Interoperability**: Standardized data formats enable information sharing
- **Audit trails**: Track who accessed records and when
- **Selective sharing**: Share only relevant information with each provider

Smart contracts can automate consent management, ensuring providers only access data they're authorized to see while maintaining compliance with healthcare regulations.

## Why Cardano

- **Privacy features** protect sensitive health information
- **Security** through proven cryptographic protocols
- **Interoperability focus** enables healthcare system integration
- **Global accessibility** supports healthcare across borders
- **Regulatory compliance** capabilities for HIPAA and similar requirements
