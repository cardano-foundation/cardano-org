# Get involved

Welcome to the [cardano.org](https://cardano.org) website. We believe that this website should be managed by a collective and not a single entity. For this to be successful, the website relies on your contributions.  

[cardano.org](https://cardano.org) follows an incremental evolution model. This repository avoids full rebuild projects, agency-led redesigns, or “start from scratch” initiatives unless there is a demonstrated, documented and reviewed technical need. Improvements should be made through small, reviewable, continuously shipped changes.


## Ways to contribute

There are many ways to contribute, even if you are not a developer.
