# Add your Company

Thank you for considering adding your company, association or collaboration to [Entities Building on Cardano](https://cardano.org/entities#companies). 

## Requirements

Before making a pull request, please make sure that you fulfill all these requirements. 

### Requirements of your company, association or collaboration 
- You can only add a registered company, an association, or a collaboration. By "collaboration" we mean open source collaborations such as the **Koios Team** or the **Guild Operators**. 
- You cannot add a product, service or tool. These can be added to the [Cardano Showcase](https://developers.cardano.org/showcase). 
- Ensure that your company/association/collaboration has a product, service or tool that is listed on either [Cardano Showcase](https://developers.cardano.org/showcase) or [Builder Tools](https://developers.cardano.org/tools).
- Your product, service, or tool needs to work today on Cardano mainnet, no coming soon, no preview, no promises, no token sales.

### Website Requirement
- Link to the company/association/collaboration website and not to the product website. Examples: don't link to **Flint Wallet** but to **dcSpark**. Don't link to **CardanoScan** but to **Strica**.
- Your company/association/collaboration website has to have a stable domain name. (a random Netlify/Vercel domain is not allowed, no URL shortener, no app store links, or similar)
- Don't link to token pages. Example: don't link to **World Mobile Token** but to **World Mobile**. 
- If you have registered your product as a company/association/collaboration or you have the same website for both, please link to a team or about Us page. Examples: entries of **DripDropz** and **jpg.store**.

### Logo Requirements
- Have your company/association/collaboration logo as SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) file. In order to maintain a certain quality standard, no jpg, png or other formats are accepted.
- You need one that looks good on white background and one that looks good a dark background. (Light mode / dark mode)
- Avoid a transparent border around the logo otherwise it will be displayed too small.
- If you specify a size in the SVG file, do not go below 600x600.

### Pull Request requirements
- The GitHub account that adds the company must not be new.
- The GitHub account that adds the company must have a history/or already be known in the Cardano community.


## Changes for the actual pull request

To create a pull request that adds your company named `Amazing Company`:

- Fulfill all the above requirements.
- Copy your two logos (light and dark mode) to the folder `static/img/logos`. Name them `amazingcompany.svg` and `amazingcompany-dark.svg`.
- Make changes to the JSON file as shown below. 
- The field `showCompanyName` can be set to true if your company logo does not already include the company name. The name of the company is then displayed under the logo. Example: TxPipe and DripDropz. 
- The field `knownFor` must be set to at least one product/service or tool that is listed on either [Cardano Showcase](https://developers.cardano.org/showcase) or [Builder Tools](https://developers.cardano.org/tools).
