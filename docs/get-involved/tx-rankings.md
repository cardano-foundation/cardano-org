## Transaction Rankings

:::info Work in Progress
This page is currently being developed. Complete documentation will be available soon.
:::

## Overview

Some apps on cardano.org are ranked based on their on-chain transaction activity over the last 30 days. This data-driven approach helps users discover the most actively used applications in the Cardano ecosystem.

## Current Implementation

Transaction-based rankings are currently displayed on:
- **Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs)** - on the [Where to get ada](/where-to-get-ada#exchanges) page

Apps with transaction data show:
- Total transaction count for the last 30 days
- Ranking position within their category (e.g., #1, #2, #3 among DEXs)
- Gold badges for top 3 positions

## Important Notes

:::caution Not All Apps Are Tracked Yet
Not all applications' transactions are currently being tracked. If your app is not ranked or shows lower numbers than expected, your transactions may not be identifiable on-chain yet.

## How to Make Your App's Transactions Identifiable

**Detailed instructions coming soon.**

To ensure your app's transactions are counted and displayed in rankings, they need to be identifiable on-chain. This typically involves using consistent smart contract addresses or transaction patterns that can be tracked. Detailed guidelines on how to structure your transactions for tracking will be published on this page shortly.
