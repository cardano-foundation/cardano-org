# Editorial Style Guide

This guide ensures consistency across all cardano.org content. Use it when writing or editing pages, news articles, and documentation.

## Writing Principles

- Use American English.
- Use date format: September 15, 2017 (MMMM DD, YYYY)
- Use gender-inclusive pronouns they/their/them rather than he/she.
- Use the Oxford comma.
- Spell out one to nine; use numerals for 10 and above.
- Avoid three-letter acronyms (TLAs). There are too many in blockchain—don't invent new ones.
