- **Active community**: Regular posts, discussions, or interactions (aim for 1000+ members)
- **Non-commercial**: Not primarily used for marketing or promotion
- **Accessible**: No paywalls, registration walls, or private-only access
- **Well-moderated**: Reliable moderation by a team (not just one person) to maintain a healthy and safe space
