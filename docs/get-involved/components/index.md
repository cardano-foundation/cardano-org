# Overview

:::info Work in Progress
The component documentation is still being finalized. However, you can find all available components in the `src/components` directory, as shown in the [folder structure](/docs/get-involved/local-copy#folder-structure). To start exploring the components, begin with those in the `src/components/Layout` directory, as these are the ones you will reuse the most.
