          <p>
            Cardano is defined by its community. Its governance model shows that
            true democracy - in which individuals are incentivized to play a
            role and votes are immutably recorded - is possible. It is a way for
            token holders to decide the future of a platform, and for the
            community to dictate the use of Cardanoâ€™s treasury funds.
          </p>

          <p>
            This model and the pioneering technology that underpins it can be
            applied to any application, system, or even society. It is a
            blueprint for change that is decided by the many, as well as the
            few, and which will redistribute power, eliminating intermediaries,
            to improve the lives of all.
