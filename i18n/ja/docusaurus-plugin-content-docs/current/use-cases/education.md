# Education Credentials

## The Challenge

The issuance of academic certifications is heavily centralized and often opaque. Traditional paper-based credentials are easily forged, difficult to verify, and can be lost or damaged. Educational institutions face challenges in maintaining the integrity of their certifications, while employers struggle to verify the authenticity of candidates' qualifications.

The verification process is slow and costly, often requiring direct contact with issuing institutions. This creates friction in hiring processes and can disadvantage qualified candidates who obtained credentials from institutions that are difficult to reach or no longer exist.

## How Blockchain Solves This

Cardano's blockchain-based identity and credentials solutions enable educational institutions to issue digital credentials that are:

- **Tamper-proof**: Once recorded on the blockchain, credentials cannot be altered or forged
- **Instantly verifiable**: Anyone can verify a credential's authenticity without contacting the issuing institution
- **Portable**: Students own their credentials and can share them with any employer or institution
- **Persistent**: Credentials remain valid and verifiable even if the issuing institution closes

Smart contracts can automate the issuance process, ensuring credentials are only issued when specific requirements are met. This creates an auditable trail of academic achievements that benefits students, institutions, and employers alike.

## Why Cardano

- **Low transaction fees** make credential issuance economically viable at scale
- **Energy-efficient proof of stake** aligns with educational institutions' sustainability goals
- **Native token support** enables certification NFTs without additional smart contract complexity
- **Aiken smart contracts** provide programmable verification logic
- **Global accessibility** ensures credentials can be verified anywhere in the world
