# Tokenized Assets

## The Challenge

Traditional investment in real-world assets like real estate, art, or commodities requires significant capital and involves complex legal and administrative processes. This excludes most people from wealth-building opportunities that have historically been reserved for the wealthy.

Even for those who can invest, assets are often illiquid, making it difficult to access funds when needed. The overhead of buying, selling, and managing these assets further reduces returns.

## How Blockchain Solves This

Asset tokenization divides ownership of real-world assets into digital tokens that can be easily traded:

- **Fractional ownership**: Own a piece of a building, artwork, or other valuable asset
- **Increased liquidity**: Trade tokens 24/7 on decentralized exchanges
- **Reduced barriers**: Lower minimum investments open opportunities to more people
- **Automated compliance**: Smart contracts can enforce regulatory requirements
- **Transparent ownership**: All ownership records are publicly verifiable

Tokenization can apply to virtually any asset class: real estate, infrastructure, commodities, collectibles, intellectual property, and more.

## Why Cardano

- **Native tokens** provide efficient, secure asset representation
- **Low transaction fees** make small trades economically viable
- **Regulatory awareness** supports compliant tokenization schemes
- **Smart contract security** through formal verification methods
- **Global accessibility** enables worldwide participation
