# Digital Identity

## The Challenge

In today's digital world, our identities are fragmented across countless platforms, each holding pieces of our personal information. Users have little control over how their data is used, shared, or monetized. Data breaches expose millions of records, identity theft is rampant, and proving who you are online remains cumbersome and privacy-invasive.

Centralized identity systems create single points of failure and give disproportionate power to identity providers. Users must repeatedly share sensitive information, creating unnecessary exposure and friction in digital interactions.

## How Blockchain Solves This

Self-sovereign identity (SSI) on Cardano puts users in control of their digital identity. Key features include:

- **User ownership**: Individuals control their identity data and decide what to share
- **Selective disclosure**: Share only the information needed for a specific transaction
- **Verifiable credentials**: Third parties can cryptographically verify claims without accessing underlying data
- **Decentralized identifiers (DIDs)**: Persistent identifiers that don't depend on any central authority
- **Privacy preservation**: Zero-knowledge proofs can verify attributes without revealing them

With blockchain-based identity, users can prove they're over 18 without revealing their birthdate, or prove they live in a certain country without revealing their address.

## Why Cardano

- **Formal verification methods** ensure identity smart contracts behave as intended
- **Extended UTXO model** provides predictable transaction costs for identity operations
- **Interoperability focus** enables identity credentials to work across different systems
- **Strong governance** ensures the platform evolves with community input
- **Scalability roadmap** supports identity solutions at global scale
