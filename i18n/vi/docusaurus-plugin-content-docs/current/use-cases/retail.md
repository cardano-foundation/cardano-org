## The Challenge

Counterfeiting costs legitimate businesses hundreds of billions of dollars annually and poses real risks to consumers. From luxury goods to electronics to pharmaceuticals, fake products flood markets worldwide. Traditional anti-counterfeiting measures like holograms and serial numbers are easily replicated.

Consumers struggle to verify product authenticity, especially when purchasing through secondary markets or online platforms. Legitimate brands face reputational damage when counterfeits bearing their name cause harm or disappointment.

## How Blockchain Solves This

Blockchain-based product authentication provides unforgeable proof of origin and ownership:

- **Digital product passports**: Each product receives a unique, verifiable digital identity
- **Ownership history**: Track the complete chain of custody from manufacturer to consumer
- **Authentication**: Consumers can verify authenticity with a simple scan
- **Secondary market trust**: Verified provenance supports resale markets
- **Warranty and service**: Automatic warranty tracking and service history

Smart contracts can link physical products to digital twins, enabling automated warranty claims, loyalty rewards, and product registration.

## Why Cardano

- **Native tokens** enable efficient product tokenization without complex smart contracts
- **Low fees** make tracking individual items economically viable
- **Immutable records** provide trustworthy provenance that cannot be falsified
- **Consumer-friendly verification** through mobile applications
- **Enterprise solutions** proven in real-world retail deployments
