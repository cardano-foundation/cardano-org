# Decentralized Finance (DeFi)

## The Challenge

Traditional financial systems exclude billions of people worldwide who lack access to banking services. Even for those with access, financial services often come with high fees, opaque terms, and centralized control that can freeze assets or deny services arbitrarily.

The 2008 financial crisis demonstrated the risks of centralized financial systems, where failures at major institutions can cascade through the entire economy. Users have little visibility into how their deposits are used or what risks they're exposed to.

## How Blockchain Solves This

Decentralized finance on Cardano provides open, transparent financial services accessible to anyone with an internet connection:

- **Permissionless access**: Anyone can participate without approval from centralized gatekeepers
- **Transparent operations**: All transactions and smart contract logic are publicly auditable
- **User custody**: Users maintain control of their assets without relying on intermediaries
- **Composability**: DeFi protocols can be combined to create new financial products
- **24/7 availability**: Services operate continuously without downtime or business hours

Cardano's DeFi ecosystem includes decentralized exchanges (DEXs), lending and borrowing platforms, stablecoins, and yield optimization protocols, all operating on secure, audited smart contracts.

## Why Cardano

- **Predictable fees** through the extended UTXO model enable accurate cost planning
- **Formal verification** provides mathematical guarantees about smart contract behavior
- **Native assets** reduce complexity and attack surface for token operations
- **Sustainability** through proof of stake aligns with long-term value creation
- **Strong community** of developers building innovative financial applications
