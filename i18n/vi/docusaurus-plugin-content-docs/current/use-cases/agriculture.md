# Agriculture

## The Challenge

Modern food supply chains are complex and opaque. Consumers increasingly want to know where their food comes from, how it was produced, and whether claims about organic, fair trade, or sustainable practices are genuine. Food fraud costs the global industry an estimated $40 billion annually.

For farmers and producers, proving the quality and origin of their products is difficult and expensive. Intermediaries capture much of the value, while producers struggle to differentiate their products in the market.

## How Blockchain Solves This

Blockchain technology creates an immutable record of a product's journey from farm to table:

- **Origin verification**: Prove exactly where products come from and how they were produced
- **Quality assurance**: Record temperature, handling, and other quality metrics throughout the supply chain
- **Certification tracking**: Verify organic, fair trade, and other certifications at every step
- **Fraud prevention**: Immutable records make it difficult to substitute or mislabel products
- **Consumer transparency**: End consumers can scan a product and see its complete history

Smart contracts can automate payments to farmers when products meet quality standards, reducing delays and disputes while ensuring fair compensation.

## Why Cardano

- **Low transaction costs** make tracking even low-value agricultural products economically viable
- **Sustainability credentials** align with environmental claims in the agriculture sector
- **Interoperability** enables integration with existing agricultural management systems
- **Global accessibility** supports smallholder farmers in developing regions
- **Proven deployments** demonstrate real-world agricultural traceability
