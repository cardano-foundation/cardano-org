# Finance KYC

## The Challenge

Know Your Customer (KYC) processes are essential for financial compliance but create significant friction for both institutions and customers. Users must repeatedly submit the same documents to different institutions, leading to duplicated effort and increased exposure of sensitive data. Financial institutions spend billions annually on KYC compliance, with much of that cost passed on to customers.

The current system is also exclusionary. The estimated 1.4 billion adults worldwide without formal identity documents are effectively locked out of the financial system, unable to access basic services like bank accounts or loans.

## How Blockchain Solves This

Blockchain-based KYC solutions create a more efficient and inclusive verification system:

- **Reusable verification**: Complete KYC once, use it across multiple institutions
- **Reduced data exposure**: Share only verification status, not underlying documents
- **Faster onboarding**: Instant verification of pre-validated credentials
- **Cost reduction**: Shared verification infrastructure reduces compliance costs
- **Inclusion**: Alternative identity verification methods can bring the unbanked into the financial system

Smart contracts can automate compliance checks, ensuring only verified users can access specific financial services while maintaining privacy and reducing manual review requirements.

## Why Cardano

- **Regulatory awareness** built into platform development from the start
- **Privacy features** enable compliant verification without unnecessary data exposure
- **Global reach** supports financial inclusion across borders
- **Low fees** make micro-transactions and small account verification economically viable
- **Enterprise partnerships** demonstrate real-world financial sector adoption
