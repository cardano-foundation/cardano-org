# Logistics

## The Challenge

Global logistics involves countless handoffs between carriers, warehouses, and customs authorities. Each handoff creates opportunities for errors, delays, disputes, and fraud. Paper-based documentation leads to inefficiencies and disputes that cost the industry billions annually.

Lack of real-time visibility makes it difficult to optimize routes, predict delays, or respond quickly to disruptions. When problems occur, determining responsibility across multiple parties becomes contentious and time-consuming.

## How Blockchain Solves This

Blockchain technology creates a shared, immutable record of logistics operations:

- **Real-time tracking**: All parties share a single source of truth about shipment status
- **Smart documentation**: Bills of lading, customs forms, and other documents digitized and verified
- **Automated compliance**: Smart contracts enforce terms and trigger payments on delivery
- **Dispute resolution**: Immutable records provide clear evidence for resolving conflicts
- **Multi-party coordination**: All stakeholders can access relevant information without intermediaries

IoT devices can automatically record location, temperature, humidity, and other conditions, creating an unbroken chain of custody documentation.

## Why Cardano

- **Scalability** supports high-volume logistics operations
- **Interoperability** enables connection with existing logistics management systems
- **Global reach** facilitates cross-border trade
- **Low latency** provides timely updates for operational decisions
- **Enterprise-ready** security and reliability
