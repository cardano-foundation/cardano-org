# Payments

## The Challenge

Cross-border payments remain slow, expensive, and opaque. Traditional remittance services charge fees averaging 6-7% globally, with some corridors exceeding 10%. Transactions can take days to settle, and recipients often have limited options for accessing funds.

For the millions of migrant workers sending money home to support their families, these fees represent a significant burden. The World Bank estimates that reducing remittance fees to 3% could save senders over $20 billion annually.

## How Blockchain Solves This

Cardano enables fast, low-cost payments that settle in minutes rather than days:

- **Low fees**: Transaction costs of fractions of a cent make small payments viable
- **Fast settlement**: Transactions confirm in minutes, not days
- **Global reach**: Anyone with internet access can send or receive payments
- **Transparent pricing**: No hidden fees or unfavorable exchange rates
- **24/7 availability**: Payments process any time, regardless of banking hours or holidays

Native tokens on Cardano enable stablecoins pegged to local currencies, reducing volatility concerns for everyday transactions while maintaining the benefits of blockchain settlement.

## Why Cardano

- **Scalability** through Hydra and other Layer 2 solutions enables high transaction throughput
- **Interoperability** allows connection with traditional payment systems
- **Security** protects against fraud and unauthorized transactions
- **Low environmental impact** through proof of stake consensus
- **Growing merchant adoption** expands real-world payment utility
