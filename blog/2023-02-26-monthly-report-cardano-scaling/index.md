Since December 2022, the Hydra project has made progress on several fronts. The team focused on aligning the implementation with the HeadV1 protocol specification, addressing gaps in the on-chain scripts, and improving the mutation test framework. The roadmap was slightly updated, with new items like creating a use case-centric roadmap. Community efforts include the Hydra for Voting project and a lite paper on Hydra for auctions. The team also outlined key themes for 2023, including achieving mainnet maturity, increasing adoption, and promoting sustainable open-source development. The goal is to position Hydra as a maintainable, community-driven project.
