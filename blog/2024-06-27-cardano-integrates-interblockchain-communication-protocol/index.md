The Cardano Foundation has integrated the Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC) to enhance connectivity and join the interchain ecosystem, addressing challenges in scalability, data privacy, and interoperability. This integration allows reliable transactions and data exchanges across distinct blockchain networks, linking Cardano to over 115 interconnected blockchains and enabling Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-based sidechains. The IBC sidechain improves enterprise blockchain deployment by offering flexibility, scalability, cross-platform innovation, operational efficiency, and security. This move aims to broaden blockchain scalability, reach, and connectivity, benefiting enterprises and developers alike.
