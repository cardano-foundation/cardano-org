Since November 2022, the Hydra project has made notable progress. The team completed the validation of the coordinated head protocol against a formal model and detailed a follow-up task on model-based testing. They focused on closing gaps in the specification to support an audit, scoped down version 0.9.0 to script updates, and moved the "Commit from external wallet" feature to the next version. Development highlights include fixing errors in the internal wallet, reducing commit costs using reference scripts, and improving CI with nix-based builds. The Hydra V1 specification is being formalized in LaTeX, and the community projects "Hydra for Payments" and "Hydra for Voting" have advanced, with the former completing its first phase. The Cardano Foundation also published a retrospective blog post on Hydra's progress in 2022.
