Since July 2023, the Hydra project has made significant progress, including the release of version 0.12.0, which introduced support for cardano-node 8.1.2, authenticated messages, event-sourced persistence, new API endpoints, and security fixes. The project roadmap has been updated to prioritize network resiliency and incremental commit/decommit features for version 0.13.0. The team also updated the Hydra tutorial to include Mithril and prepared for a Hydra master class at RareEvo 2023, which had positive feedback. In addition, the team participated in Catalyst Fund10, reviewing several proposals related to Hydra and Mithril.
