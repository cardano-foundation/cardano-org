Cardano is a third-generation, layer 1 blockchain that enhances scalability, security, and efficiency, building on the strengths of Bitcoin and Ethereum while addressing their limitations. It employs a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, using its native cryptocurrency, ada, for governance and network security. Cardanoâ€™s extended UTXO model supports secure, deterministic smart contracts, making it ideal for enterprise-grade applications. Its rigorous, peer-reviewed development approach, diverse use cases, and evolving governance model position Cardano as a leading platform for decentralized applications, tokenization, and blockchain solutions across multiple industries.
