In a November 20 blog post, Intersect announced a proposal for the next Cardano mainnet hard fork. This upgrade stems from recently completed core Haskell node work. To manage this process, Intersect will convene a Hard Fork Working Group (HFWG) to coordinate ecosystem feedback, impact assessment, and communication before any formal governance actions are raised. An initial virtual HFWG event is scheduled for December 2 to discuss impact, communication, and naming conventions.
