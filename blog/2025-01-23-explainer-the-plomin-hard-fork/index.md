The Plomin hard fork is a key upgrade for Cardano, enabling full decentralized governance under the Voltaire era. It allows ada holders to delegate voting power to DReps for decisions on protocol updates, treasury withdrawals, and hard forks. SPOs must upgrade their nodes and achieve a 51% majority vote for activation. With 78% of nodes upgraded as of January 22, 2025, Plomin marks a milestone for community-driven control.
