Since January 2023, the Hydra project has made significant progress. Version 0.9.0 was released, incorporating on-chain and off-chain updates, with a focus now on achieving mainnet compatibility for version 0.10.0. The roadmap was updated to align with 2023 objectives, including new items like creating a use case-centric roadmap and opening the specification with a change process. Key development work included aligning the implementation with the HeadV1 specification, improving Hydra transaction profiling, and addressing off-chain protocol logic. Community efforts included audit guidelines, a new tutorial, and ongoing collaborations like Hydra for Payments and Hydra for Voting. The Hydra project also expanded its presence on Discord to engage more with the community.
