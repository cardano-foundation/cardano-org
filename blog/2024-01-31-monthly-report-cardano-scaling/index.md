Since November 2023, the Hydra project has made significant progress. Version 0.15.0 was released, featuring offline mode and Conway support. The team also prepared for running Cardano nodes in P2P mode, with non-P2P relays shutting down in January 2024. Notable developments include API changes, removing JSON transactions in favor of CBOR encoding, and ongoing work on Hydra Chess to refine the DApp workflow. Additionally, the Hydra Explorer was initiated to track Hydra heads. The team is also involved in community events like the upcoming Cardano Buidler Fest and supporting Catalyst projects, including streaming API and Hydra auctions.
