On January 29, 2025, Cardano transitioned to full community governance with the Plomin hard fork, approved by stake pool operators and the interim constitutional committee. This historic event marks the first community-driven hard fork in blockchain history, stemming from CIP-1694 developed over two years with extensive community input. Ada holders can now propose and vote on governance actions directly or through delegated representatives (DReps). Post-Plomin, staking rewards continue as usual; however, withdrawing them requires delegation to a DRep or selecting a predefined option. This milestone signifies a new era of decentralized decision-making for Cardano.
