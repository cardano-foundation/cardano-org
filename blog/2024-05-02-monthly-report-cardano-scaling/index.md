In April, the Mithril project focused on increasing SPO participation, reaching 258 registered signers, representing 22% of Cardano’s active stake. Key updates included a pre-release of distribution 2418.1 and decentralization experiments for the signer registration process. The Hydra project updated its roadmap, emphasizing incremental commits and decommits, and introduced enhancements to the /commit endpoint. The Cardano Buidler Fest featured significant contributions, including the integration of Mithril into Cardano’s IBC protocol and Sundae Labs’ development of the Gummiworm fork for enhanced security in Hydra heads. Logo designs for both projects were also refreshed.
