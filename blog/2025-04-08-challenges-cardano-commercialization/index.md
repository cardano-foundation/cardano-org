EMURGO's recent workshops in Tokyo and Fukuoka highlighted key challenges to Cardano's commercialization: limited liquidity, low transaction volume, and underdeveloped DeFi infrastructure. With Cardano ranking 20th in total value locked (TVL) among blockchains and its stablecoin market cap at $30 million, the ecosystem lags behind competitors. Contributing factors include scarce listings of Cardano-native tokens on major exchanges and minimal engagement with external market makers. Addressing these issues is crucial for enhancing Cardano's infrastructure, attracting institutional capital, and achieving its vision of a resilient, inclusive financial platform. EMURGO plans to propose solutions in an upcoming blog post.
