# note: don't use relative links here, as this data is built into different paths
#       for example /news/tags/developers vs /news
#
# todo: idea is to only add regular authors, you can also add one-off authors in
#       the news files directly, but we need to agree whether the author list should be
#       mandatory (instead of one-off authors, as one-off entries are difficult to maintain)
#
# todo: Would be nice to start with a decent group of regular authors / entities
#
# todo: use good title: tags to explain authors/groups who are posting here
