Since February 2023, the Hydra project released version 0.9.0, which brought significant on-chain and off-chain updates, including cost reductions in Plutus scripts, improved mutation testing, and the addition of a new tutorial. The focus now shifts to making Hydra mainnet compatible, with version 0.10.0 being the first mainnet-ready release. The roadmap was updated, prioritizing API configurability and marking less-demanded features as ideas for discussion. The team also optimized on-chain scripts and improved Hydra's UX. A key milestone was opening a Hydra head on the Cardano mainnet during a team workshop in Austria.
