The Cardano Foundation's recent research paper, "Serial Monopoly on Blockchain with Quasi-Patient Users," co-authored with IOG Research, examines transaction fee mechanisms and their influence on validator incentives. Accepted for presentation at the 29th International Financial Cryptography and Data Security 2025 conference, the study introduces a model bridging impatient and patient users, termed "quasi-patient" users. This approach analyzes how users' varying tolerance for transaction delays impacts fee strategies and blockchain security, offering insights into optimizing transaction fee mechanisms to balance cost efficiency and timely inclusion.
