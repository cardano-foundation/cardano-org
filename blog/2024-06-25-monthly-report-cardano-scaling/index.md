The Mithril project in June saw the release of distribution 2423.0, including critical updates like removing the deprecated snapshot command and improving transaction certification performance. Work on Cardano integration progressed, focusing on decentralizing signature diffusion. The Hydra project made significant strides with incremental decommits, updating the protocol's specification, and fixing a critical bug in the decommit feature. They also made breaking changes to the hydra-node API and enhanced the system's security and efficiency, with a planned release in the near future.
