The article "An Introduction to Proof of Stake Blockchain Systems" from the Cardano Foundation explains how proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanisms offer a more energy-efficient and decentralized alternative to proof-of-work (PoW) systems. In PoS, validators are selected based on the amount of cryptocurrency they hold and are willing to "stake" as collateral, reducing the need for energy-intensive computations. The article discusses various PoS models, including Cardano's Ouroboros protocol, which uses a verifiable random function to ensure fairness and security. It also highlights how different PoS systems balance decentralization, security, and scalability to meet diverse blockchain needs.
