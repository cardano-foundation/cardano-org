Since May 2023, the Hydra team has focused on several key developments, preparing for the upcoming version 0.11.0 release. Notable updates include allowing commits with multiple UTXOs, enhancing off-chain performance, and introducing commits from external wallets. The team also benchmarked Hydra Head performance, identified persistence as a bottleneck, and made improvements based on real-world usage. Community engagement included planning a Hydra workshop and concluding the Hydra for Auctions project, which successfully demonstrated moving smart contracts from layer 1 to layer 2 for enhanced scalability.
