A blockchain hard fork upgrades the software run by distributed nodes, introducing new features and improving security. Cardano uses a hard fork combinator (HFC) for smooth transitions. The Chang Hard Fork requires 70% of stake pool operators and 80% of exchange liquidity to upgrade, marking the start of community-run governance outlined in CIP-1694.
