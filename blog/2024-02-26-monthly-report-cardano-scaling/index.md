The first joint report for Hydra and Mithril projects highlights progress since January 2024. Mithril released distribution 2408.0, with updates like SanchoNet network release and Cardano transaction certification. Enhanced support for Conway and SanchoNet was also implemented. Hydra saw roadmap changes, with significant updates including dropping JSON encoded transaction support, progress on the Hydra heads explorer, and work on incremental commit features. The team resolved a fanout bug discovered during hydra-chess development and deployed a Hydra explorer supporting multiple versions, though it currently supports only one version per network.
