Since April 2023, the Hydra project released version 0.10.0, the first mainnet-compatible release, which includes key features like limited mainnet exposure, client API enhancements, and quality-of-life improvements for running the hydra-node. The team focused on timed transactions, removing unnecessary configuration options, and improving continuous integration (CI) performance. Community contributions included the Hydrozoa research proposal and updates to the Hydra for Payments project, which aims to make Hydra more accessible for payment use cases with the HydraNow mobile app. The team continues to refine and expand Hydra's capabilities and user experience.
