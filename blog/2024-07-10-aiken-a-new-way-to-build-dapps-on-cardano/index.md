Decentralized applications (dApps) use programmable smart contracts on blockchain to provide accessible services without central authority. Unlike traditional apps with centralized backends, dApps run on open-source, decentralized networks like Cardano, offering transparency and security. Cardano, a third-generation blockchain, supports scalable, secure, and interoperable dApp development. Aiken simplifies dApp development on Cardano by offering familiar syntax, an easy compiler, and clear error handling. Itâ€™s used by popular Cardano dApps like Minswap, Sundae Swap, LenFi, and JPG Store, facilitating faster and more efficient dApp creation.
