The January 20, 2025, *Cardano Community Digest* urges all node users, especially Stake Pool Operators (SPOs), to upgrade to node version 10.1.4 to prepare for the Plomin hard fork. As of now, 85% of blocks are produced using this version. The Interim Constitutional Committee (iCC) is assessing the governance action's constitutionality, requiring a two-thirds majority by January 25, 2025. The Digest also introduces Cardano Delegated Representatives (DReps) on the Cardano Forum and discusses the network's minimum pool cost.
