Since March 2023, the Hydra project made significant progress, focusing on preparing for the 0.10.0 release, which will be the first mainnet-compatible version. Key developments include updates to the configurable API, enhancements to the Hydra specification, and fixing script continuity issues. The team also addressed a rollback bug that affected the opening of Hydra heads on the mainnet.
