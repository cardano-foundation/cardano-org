In March, Mithril saw an increase in SPO participation, reaching 230 pools with 4.6B₳ stake, representing 20% of the active stake. The release of Mithril distribution 2412.0 included support for Prometheus metrics, Pallas-based chain observer implementation, and the deprecation of the snapshot command. Hydra focused on incremental commits and decommits, Conway era support, and preparing for the 0.16.0 release.
